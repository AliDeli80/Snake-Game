## How to Play

- Move the Snake: Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction.

2. Snake and Food: The snake and food are represented by HTML elements.
3. Game Logic: JavaScript handles the game logic, including snake movement, food generation, collision detection, and scorekeeping.
4. Game Over: When the snake collides with a wall or itself, the game ends, and a game over message is displayed.

## Feature

- Scorekeeping: Track your high score and improve your skills.

## Customization
